# System operating shell

A simple linux shell created under CMC MSU operating system course.
For task requirements see *PRD.pdf*, also see *help.txt* for additional information.

You can use arrow keys to get command from history, just like in real shell.

## Build

Just run:

```bash
make
./sos
```

Use `help` command to see all available commands.
